            <h2 class="topic">Privacy Policy</h2>
        </center>

        <p>The privacy and security of your information is very important to us. Whether you are booking a room or just a prospective client browsing our website (the “Site”) and looking at our property/services, we want you to trust that the information that you have provided to us is being properly managed and protected.</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy is issued by The Ivey’s Hotel (the “Hotel”), which includes its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and covers information collected and used by the Hotel in the course of its business. Your information may be collected and used by the Hotel through your use of this Site. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain more about how we collect and manage your information.</p>

        <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT:</h2>
        <p>Information you give us. In your use of the Site, you may provide us with various information that personally identifies you. For example, we collect information from you when you make a booking through our reservation system or stay at the Hotel. Information collected during the course of the reservation and during your stay may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name, email address, home and business address, phone number, nationality and payment card information; and</li>
            <li>Information such as stay and room preferences made during the course of your reservation such as your preferred room type and specific requests to the Hotel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information may be provided to us directly when you make a reservation through our reservation system, through our websites, directly at the hotel or through mobile applications. In some cases, we may receive this information from a third party, such as when you book through an online travel agency or hotel booking site.</p>

        <h2>INFORMATION WE GET FROM YOUR USE OF THE SITE:</h2>
        <p>We also collect information from you when you browse the Site, use our mobile applications or participate in certain services at the Hotel, such as wireless internet services. In these instances, information such as your country information, internet protocol (“IP”) address, media access control address and other characteristics about your system or device may be automatically collected. This information may be collected for functional purposes as well as to improve your experience when using these services. This information may also be used for aggregated trend and statistical analysis, and for showing you more relevant advertisements and messages. Site usage may also provide us with other information including, without limitation, domain server, type of computer, and type of web browser and other relevant information about your online experience and use of the Site.</p>

        <h2>INFORMATION STORED ON YOUR COMPUTER (“COOKIES”):</h2>
        <p>When you visit this Site, the Hotel may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "cookie" or similar file and can help us maintain and improve this Site. A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card, recording such things as Internet addresses, passwords, and preferences. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. With most Internet browsers, you can erase "cookies" from your computer hard drive, block all "cookies," or receive a warning before a "cookie" is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions to learn more about these functions.</p>

        <h2>HOW WE USE THIS INFORMATION:</h2>
        <p>We use the information collected from you primarily to fulfill your hotel reservation. Prior to your stay, this may include sending your information to the Hotel or sending you pre-stay communications. Following your stay, we may also send you post-stay communications and satisfaction surveys to get feedback on your experience.</p>

        <p>In some instances where we have your consent or where permitted under applicable law, we may send you marketing communications (which may include text messages) for products and services that we believe would be relevant for you. We also may use information related to your stay to display targeted advertisements on our websites or on third party websites or to send you more relevant messaging. Additionally, we use this information for purposes of aggregated trend and statistical analysis to evaluate and improve our products and services, plan new hotel locations and services and other market research.</p>
